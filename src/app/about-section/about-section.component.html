                Wordsense is an NLP and speech engineering and research company focussed on building Automl solutions
                and
                custom apis for enterprises.

                At wordsense, we want to help enterprises operationalise AI. We truly believe that AI technology should
                be
                more accessible and cheap.

            <p class="text-container">Most big players either solve these problems with a big internal team of ML
                researcher, Platform
                engineers, full stack developer and business analysts or outsource to some technology company with
                similar team size.

                Usually it take couple to months to deploy only a POC grade solution which is not scalable by design
                for
                production. That takes another couple of months.
                <br>
                <br>

                Average cost for a POC grade solution is in the range of $100k to $200k for 8-12 weeks engagement.
                Also
                considerable amount of time in invested in collecting data and tagging it

                <br>
                <br>

                Usually no deep expertise in NLP/NLU/Speech in these solutions since it requires years of similar
                problem solving or deep research oriented teams. Hence the solution is often discarded or the
                production
                pipeline drastically changes.
                <br>
                <br>


                Machine learning models keep advancing and given the nature of solution,solutions provided by a
                service
                focussed player fails to upgrage or perform good over time. Also there is a huge investment involved
                in
                support or any enhancement engagement

            <br>
            <p class="text-container">We believe that if we ship, we should own it. Our platform constantly upgrades the
                underlying technology
                with state of the art research. Which means, we don't buy customer's time or money to upgrade the apis
                and offering.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most clients don't have a lot of usable data to start off. Our platform by design, uses less amount of
                data to jump start or fine-tune the models powering our existing apis.
                <br>
                <br>
                We also believe that the best AI doesn't come from boxed solution offered by a team. We thing we can
                provide powerful apis that developers can use on top of their work for solutioning.
                <br>
                <br>
                Analytics dashboard for all the platform offerings with customizable KPI cards. This gives quick
                insights to anything that goes live.
